## Profile
Solution Architects with AWS are very experienced professionals, with real world experience, 
working in multiple industry sectors. They have to be knowledgable creative IT professionals 
who can relate effectively to both developers and management, and need to be able to creatively 
guide customers both on moving existing applications to AWS, but also on architecting on AWS for new applications.


## Interview Process
The interview will likely focus a lot on architecture, how you communicate, how you present ideas, 
how you build trust in your ability with a customer and would certainly cover aspects such as your 
understanding of AWS’ value proposition, services, as well as business aspects that are important for customers.

Amazon take their [leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/principles) seriously, 
you should know them, apply them to your own experience, and be able to relate to them personally.


## Technical Section

**You will be tested in the following 4 areas**

**1. System Design: You will be given a scenario and will be asked to design it.**

**2. Software Engineering Principles: Understanding of REST APIs and OOP principles.**

**3. Networking Concepts: Understanding of Sessions, Authentication, Caching, 
Encryption, security, HTTP vs HTTPS and working of OSI layers is extremely important.**

## Behavioural
Make sure to answer all questions using the STAR method. 
The questions that were asked were no different than the ones that 
have been posted on Glassdoor. The key indicator of success is to give
precise answers that will showcase what you have done i.e. never use "we"
always narrate your answers using "I".

The interviewer tested me on different components of software architecture: 
- Front End
- Back End
- Application Server
- Web Server
