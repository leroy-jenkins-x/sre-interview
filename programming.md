# Algorithms on Integers
generate subsets recursively

Given n balls where each ball has different weight, combine them into a single ball by taking 2 balls at a time. 
The cost of each step is the sum of the weights of the balls being combining. Minimize the cost.

Given a matrix where each row initially contains vowels and then consonants, find the row with the maximum number of vowels.
Optimize it to O(m+n).


# Graphs
Focus on 1 data structure at a time, for example
try to learn everything there is to know about a binary tree:
traversals, reconstruct from traversals, level sum, minimum level sum etc.
